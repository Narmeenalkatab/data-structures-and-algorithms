# Insertion Sort Algorithm Explanation
## Initial Array: [8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]

Step 1: Initialize the sorted array.

- Initialize an empty array called `sorted`.

Step 2: Insert the first element.

- Assign the first element of the input array to the `sorted` array.
- `sorted = [8]`

Step 3: Insert the remaining elements.

- Iterate through the input array starting from the second element and call the `Insert` function for each element.

Iteration 1: Insert 4

- Compare 4 with the elements in the `sorted` array.
- Since 4 is smaller than 8, we move 8 one position to the right and insert 4 at the first index.
- `sorted = [4, 8]`

Iteration 2: Insert 23

- Compare 23 with the elements in the `sorted` array.
- 23 is greater than 4 and 8, so we append it to the end.
- `sorted = [4, 8, 23]`

Iteration 3: Insert 42

- Compare 42 with the elements in the `sorted` array.
- 42 is greater than 4, 8, and 23, so we append it to the end.
- `sorted = [4, 8, 23, 42]`

Iteration 4: Insert 16

- Compare 16 with the elements in the `sorted` array.
- 16 is smaller than 42 but greater than 23.
- Move 42 one position to the right, then move 23 one position to the right, and finally insert 16 at the third index.
- `sorted = [4, 8, 16, 23, 42]`

Iteration 5: Insert 15

- Compare 15 with the elements in the `sorted` array.
- 15 is smaller than all the elements in the `sorted` array.
- Move 42 one position to the right, then move 23 one position to the right, then move 16 one position to the right, and finally insert 15 at the first index.
- `sorted = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]`

### Final Sorted Array: [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

## Insertion Sort Implementation in Python

```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        value = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > value:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = value
    return arr

sample_array = [8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]
sorted_array = insertion_sort(sample_array)
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
