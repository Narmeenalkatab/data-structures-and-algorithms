## Approach & Efficiency
Sorting Numbers:

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Sorting Strings:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Sorting Objects:

Time Complexity: O(1) to O(k)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Ignoring Leading Words:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Sorting Movies:

Time Complexity: O(n log n)
